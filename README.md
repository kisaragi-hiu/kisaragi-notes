# Kisaragi Hiu's Org-roam v1 fork

I don't want to adapt to Org-roam v2 because I have built a file-based no-ID workflow in my notes and don't want to change it, and I don't really want any more changes.

I plan to also merge other v1 packages into this repository.

I cannot guarantee that this version will be useful for anybody other than me. There are many itches that I had with Org-roam v1 that conflicted with what other users expected, and those are the changes that I might make in this fork.

I'll probably change the name to minimize confusion.

## Credits

The vast majority of the work comes from [Org-roam](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam), Â© Jethro Kuan and contributors & distributed under GPLv3.

I also merged Org-roam-bibtex ([5236917](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-bibtex/commit/5236917e1d8a4f88daadacc690248854f53facb4)) into this repository.

I'll eventually merge the functionalities of md-roam into this repository as well.
