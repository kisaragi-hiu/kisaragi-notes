#+title: Minaduki

* Introduction

Minaduki is my fork of Org-roam v1.

* Keywords

- title :: the main title of the file. (TODO: multiple title keywords should be concatenated)
- created :: the timestamp (in =YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ=) when the file was first created
- alias :: an alternative title.
- (to be renamed) =roam_key= :: a unique identifier for this file. Could be a link or any other ID. This is used to associate bibliography items with note files, as well as for citation backlinks.
- (to be renamed) =roam_tags= :: a list of tags.

Headline notes are indicated with a leading star (regardless of heading level or whether it's Markdown or Org). Headline notes are headlines that have an =ID= property.
