When called with a `C-u' prefix (i.e. when ARG is 4), forces the
default format without the formatting.

FILTER can either be a string or a function:

- If it is a string, it should be the type of refs to include as
  candidates \(e.g. \"cite\", \"website\", etc.)

- If it is a function, it should be the name of a function that
  takes three arguments: the type, the ref, and the file of the
  current candidate. It should return t if that candidate is to
  be included as a candidate."
