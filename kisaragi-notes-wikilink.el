;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Links that refer to titles of files instead of filepaths.
;;
;; Currently this is a copy of org-roam-link.el.
;;
;; In Org mode, these links are written as
;;
;;     [[roam:Title of my file]]
;;
;; which will be replaced with a normal link on save or when visited.
;;
;; With a headline:
;;
;;     [[roam:Title of my file*A headline]]
;;
;; it will be replaced with an ID link.
;;
;; Current plans:
;;
;; - rename roam: prefix to note:
;; - support [[Title#Headline]] in Markdown
;; - maybe support not replacing the links
